# Lok

This is my third attempt at making a programming language. The previous two attempts can be found at [TheOnlyMrCat/lok-r1](https://github.com/TheOnlyMrCat/lok-r1) and [TheOnlyMrCat/lok-r2](https://github.com/TheOnlyMrCat/lok-r2)

My third attempt is written in Rust and takes much inspiration from it in syntax and features.
